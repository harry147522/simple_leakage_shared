!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!custom2 setup!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! In custom2 there are 3 zones: Zone 1 begins large and logly gets
! smaller over a number of cells, this is to minimize the effect of
! the 1/r^2 origin issue (or so we think).  Zone 2 is a constant cell
! size zone, this is to maintain resolution around the PNS surface.
! Zone 3 is a log zone that gradually increases as you get farther
! away from the center
!
! Inputs needed:
!    grid_custom_dx1: smallest cell size ~100m
!    grid_custom_inner: size of innermost cell ~1000m
!    grid_custom_number: number of cells in Zone 1 ~10
!    grid_custom_rad1: radius where the constant zoning stops ~20km
!    grid_rmax: maximum radius in simulation, does not have to be exact
